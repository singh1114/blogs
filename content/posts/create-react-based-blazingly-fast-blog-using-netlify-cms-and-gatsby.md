I have been writing posts on a [Jekyll and GitHub pages blog](https://ranvir.xyz/blog) since a long time. Some weeks ago, my colleague shared the Gatsby blog that he created for his personal blog.

He has also written a good post on [JavaScript Proxies](https://www.arbazsiddiqui.me/javascript-proxies-real-world-use-cases/) that you will enjoy reading.

Whenever I see a new website, I immediately head over to Google's pagespeed insight to find out the speed of the page. I was astonished by the speed that the page was able to achieve.

Honestly speaking I was never able to reach to those numbers on the Jekyll blog.
